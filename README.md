# Bite Size Cake Demos

This is a trimmed down version of the [more complete Cake talk](https://github.com/gep13-talks/CakeDemos) that I have given a number of times in the past.

In this session we will start with a standard .NET Solution and incrementally add a build and orchestration script to compile the application, run unit tests, perform static analysis, package the application, and more, with the C# skills that you already have, using the Cake Build Automation System.
